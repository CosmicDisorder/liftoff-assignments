# Project Outline
### Overview
My project will be a menu log that updates in real-time both the food and beverage options currently available at participating restaurants as determined by menu items active in a point of sales system. Also, it will allow users to view establishments with add food/beverage pairing specificity, and enhance their experience at the establishment with the potential review items, view item details including invormation and ratings from Yelp and Untappd on beer and food, and interact with the establishment and other guests. Establishments will be able to curate advanced details of menu items and give users feedback.

This project was motivated by experience in the food and beverage field and at brewpubs, specifically UCBC's experimental location.
### Features
* View restaurants: can be ordered by location/type/items/yelp or untappd categories & ratings
* Inventory informed menus: depending on an establishment's use of inventory features in their POS, menus will show minimally items in stock, potentially showing items running low or that will shortly be discontinued.
* Advanced restaurant views: restaurants can be viewed with expandable menus and optional filters showing what items they typically/currently carry, what items are popular, and advanced details and ratings of menu options.
* User checkins: users will be able to document experiences at establishments, even giving feedback on particular menu items or interacting with other guests
* Favorite item view: users can see which establishments have their favorite items on the menu
* User view: users can be seen by a blog of items they've reviewed, establishments they've visited, or favorite food/drink items.

### Technologies
* Java
* Spring Boot
* REST
* MySQL
* potential others

### What I'll Have to Learn
Computer technologies I will investigate include API interactions, integrating RESTful endpoints, how to listen for updates from a POS. 

Programming practices I will develop are using project management, attempting an Agile workpace, and learning the terminology for communicating these goals and practices.
